# AutomationFrameworkWithSpecFlow
A simple from-scratch framework using specflow, C#, NUnit, and Selenium/Webdriver.
In this project I learned the small differences between using Specflow in an NUnit framework versus just using NUnit with Selenium/Webdriver. 
I separated out my actions (methods) from my element declarations for easy updating if it ever needs it. 
I hope to add screen capturing to this project eventually.
